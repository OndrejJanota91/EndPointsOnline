            <p>
                Licenses are sold only as floating, use-time licenses. Each license is valid for 365 days. If you already own a license and want to extend 
                its number, you will be charged only for the rest of the time period for your current license. Future releases and updates are free until you have an active license. EndPoints does not care where do you sit or how many computers you use until you reach a maximum number of licenses at any given time.
                If you use multiple computers or your team uses EndPoints one at a time you do not to order multiple licenses.

            <h3>How to manage your license</h3>
            <p>
                EndPoints integrates the licensing system directly into Grasshopper. By hovering over the license button in the top menu bar, options will appear. Here you can activate/release your license for your currently used computer.
                Delete the license from a current computer or get info about currently active users and license expiration.

                        <b>Activate license</b>: Open dialog for activation of your license on your current computer. Two keys are needed for activation (license key and license token). If both are correct and
                        there are free licenses available, EndPoints will be activated after the Validate button is clicked. Otherwise, the message box will be shown with the information about why the license was not activated.<br>
                        If the checkbox remembers is checked, the license will be saved on your computer and automatically activated the next time Grasshopper is opened.

                EndPoints's license automatic activation during Grasshopper opening can tracked in the Rhino's command line. Activation, reactivation and deletion of your licenses via the plugin top bar menu are communicated by showing message windows.
