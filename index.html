            <h3>About EndPoints</h3>
            <p>Hello dear Grasshopper user. Thank you for your interest in EndPoints plugin. Plugin was developed for the
            purpose of importing alignment and digital terrain model (DTM) into Rhino/Grasshopper. Imported elements are intended to serve
            as initial input for design of different infrastructure parts (e.g. bridges, tunels, rail and road structure). However, how
            plugin is used is fully up to the user.

            <h3>About LandXML</h3>
            <p>LandXML schema is a opensource project for sharing topography of terrain data. It is widely used in civil engineering, especially in transportation
            sector. Most of the software used in civil enginering is able to import and export data to LandXML format.  XML schema Official LandXML schema website 
            can be found at <a href = "http://www.landxml.org/">http://www.landxml.org/.</a> There are multiple LandXML schemas. EndPoints plugin was tested against
            schema 1.0 and 1.2. Schema 1.1 and 2.0 (working draft since 2014) should work as well, but was no tested. In case of any inconveniece with schema 1.1 and 
            2.0, please contact author.

    <section id="part2">
        <h2>Coordinate system and units</h2>
    <p>Grasshopper is unitless and units depend on the actual unit system setting in Rhino. However, LandXML is not 
        unitless, automatic unit conversion was not included into LandXML import engine. It is up to user to know LandXML units
        and set similar units in the Rhino.
    </p>
    <p>Used coordiante systems are country/region dependend It is not possible to include general approach for all coordiante system. Therefore, only most commonly used coordinate system
    were implemented. Commonly used coordiante system for different regions can be found at <a href = "https://epsg.io/">https://epsg.io/</a> website. 
    Currently following coordinate systems are implemented and automatically transformed if applied in LandXML:
    <ul class="main-list2">
        <li><a href="https://epsg.io/2065">S-JTSK (Ferro) / Krovak (EPSG: 2065)</a>
        <li><a href="https://epsg.io/5111">ETRS89 / NTM zone 11 (EPSG: 5111)</a><br>
    </ul>    
    Otherwise no transformation of coordinates is done and components <b>SurfaceNames</b> and <b>AlignmentNames</b> will produce a warning message. If this occurs please double check the result and contact author for 
    coordinate system implementaion. 
    </p>

    <section id="part3">
        <h2>Surface</h2>
    <p>Surface in LandXML is be represented by TIN surface or GRID surface. Both cases are implemented in EndPoints plugin. Surface in LandXML is written as a colletion of numbered points and faces. Faces can be 
    defined by 3 or 4 points. Surface source data (boudaries, breaklines, contours .etc) are not imported to Grasshopper as they are not important for our cause.
    </p>
        <section id="part31">
            <h3>Load .XML file with surfaces</h3>
            <p>Every .XML file surface import must start by selecting surfaces for import from the .XML file. To read all surface names in .XML file use <b>SurfaceNames</b> component.</p>    
            <img src="Pictures/SurfaceNames.png" alt="Read surface names" width="600">
            <p><b>SurfaceNames</b> component has two inputs and two outputs. First input parameter <i>PathToXML</i> is string containing path to .XML file.
                Input parameter <i>Header</i> is optional and should be used only if for unimplemented LandXML schemas. For implemented schemas see <a href="#part12">About LandXML</a> section.</p>
            <p>Output  parameter <i>SurfaceNames</i> is list of all surfaces present in the .XML file. Second output parameter <i>Namespace</i> is a 
                plugin class with the information about the general .XML data and coordinate system.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="part32">
            <h3>Select surface</h3>
            <p>Next step is to select which surfaces user want to import. This is fully up to user and selection should be performed according to users habits.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="part33">
            <h3>Create surface</h3>           
            <p>Surface can be created in multiple ways but always with <b>CreateSurface</b> component. Final surface can be represented by mesh (fast but less accurate),
            unjoined triangle/quad surfaces (fast and accurate) or by joined surface (slow and accurate). For more information see <a href = "#part5">settings</a> section.</p>
            <img src="Pictures/SurfaceCreation.png" alt="Different surface selection" width="800">
            <p><b>CreateSurface</b> component has three inputs and one output. First input parameter <i>SurfaceNames</i> is list of selected surface names which will be created.
                Parameter <i>Boundary</i> is optional. If user provides list of closed curves to this parameter only part of the triangle/quads with all corner points inside boundary will be created. Inner/outer
                point location is assessed according to projection to word XY plane. Z coodinate is neglected. If boundary is applied, imported surface can be divided into multiple parts in some cases. If whole surface is outside 
                curve nothing is created. Note that only closed curves can be used as boundary curves. If open curve is boundary curve is ignored.
                Parameter <i>Namespace</i> is mandatory and corresponds to the <b>SurfaceNames</b> output parametr <i>Namespaces</i>. It provides component with the info about .XML file so file does not have to be reopend. 
            <p>Output parameter <i>Surface</i> is list of all imported surfaces represented by mesh/list of surfaces or signel brep. 
            <p>If import is performed correctly message "Done" with the information about the computational time is shown below component. In case of large surfaces it is convenient to import surface first as a mesh 
            or unjoined surfaces and then aplly boundary curve. Please keep in mind, joining surface into one large brep is the most CPU time consuming operation.

        <h2>Alignment</h2>
        <p>Alignment (general 3D curve) in LandXML is represented by horizontal and vertical profiles curves. Both curves are defined by multiple geometrical entities. <a href="http://www.landxml.org/schema/landxml-1.2/documentation/LandXML-1.2Doc_CoordGeom.html#Link07F13620">Horizontal profile</a> (XY plane center line) is usually made of straight lines, arcs and transition curves. 
        Transition curves are named <a href="http://www.landxml.org/schema/landxml-1.2/documentation/LandXML-1.2Doc_Spiral.html#Link07F13238">spirals</a> in LandXML. <b>Please note, only spiral "Clothoid" type is implemented in EndPoints plugin.</b>
        Other possible spiral types can be found <a href ="http://www.landxml.org/schema/landxml-1.2/documentation/LandXML-1.2Doc_Spiral.html#Link07F16770"> here</a>. If unimplemented spiral type is present component <b> CreateAlignment</b> will produce 
        a warning message. In that case please contact author and provide a .XML file to author. I will gladly implement new spiral types to EndPoints if possible.</p>
        <img src="Pictures/UnimplementeSubCurve.gif" alt="Unimplemente SubCurve">    
        <p><a href="http://www.landxml.org/schema/landxml-1.2/documentation/LandXML-1.2Doc_Profile.html#Link07F62A90">Vertical profile</a> (XZ plane profile curve) is be represented by <a href="http://www.landxml.org/schema/landxml-1.2/documentation/LandXML-1.2Doc_ProfAlign.html#Link07F630D0">ProfAlign</a> or <a href="http://www.landxml.org/schema/landxml-1.2/documentation/LandXML-1.2Doc_ProfSurf.html#Link07F62DB0">ProfSurf</a> type curve.
        ProfAlign is created by points of vertical intersection (PVI), parabolic curves (ParaCurve), unsymetric parabolic curve (UnsymParaCurve) or arcs (CircCurve). ProfiAlign is typically used for road, rail profile curve. ProfSurf is represented by list of 2D points (PntList2D). ProfSurf is typicaly used for exporting intersetion of two surfaces (e.g. terrain and road slopes). Both types and all geometric entities are implemented in EndPoints.

            <h3>Load .XML file with alignment</h3>
            <p>Every .XML file alignment import must start by selecting alignment (horizontal profile) and profile (vertical profile) names for import from the .XML file. To read all alignment and profile names and other alignment data in .XML file use <b>AlignmentNames</b> component.</p>    
            <img src="Pictures/AlignmentNames.png" alt="Read alignment names" width="600">
            <p><b>AlignmentNames</b> component has two inputs and five outputs. First input parameter <i>PathToXML</i> is string containing path to .XML file.
            Input parameter <i>Header</i> is optional and should be used only if for unimplemented LandXML schemas. For implemented schemas see <a href="#part12">About LandXML</a> section.</p>
            <p>Output parameter <i>AlignmentNames</i> is a list of all alignments (horizontal profiles) present in the .XML file. Second output parameter <i>ProfileNames</i> is a tree of all profiles (vertical profiles) present in .XML file. 
            Profiles count can be higher then number of alignments as one alignment can contain multiple profiles. Each branch contains all profiles which belongs to the alignment on the same position as branch number is. 
            In some cases (not so unusual), start and end stationing of horizontal and vertical profiles may not match. Alignment points which are not inside both domains cannot be calculated as only part of data are present. Therefore, 
            output parameters <i>StartSta</i> / <i>EndSta</i> were presented. Both outputs are trees with a min./max. valid stationing which can be reached on the alignment for each profile. Minimum stationing is always max. value of (vertical profile start stationing; horizontal profile start stationing).
            Maximum stationing is always min. value of (vertical profile start stationing; horizontal profile start stationing).
            Tree structure of <i>StartSta</i> / <i>EndSta</i> matches structure of <i>ProfileNames</i> output.
            Last output parameter <i>Namespace</i> is a plugin class with the information about the general .XML data and coordinate system.</p>

        <section id="part42">
            <h3>Select alignment (horizontal profile) and profile (vertical profile)</h3>
            <p>Next step is to select which alignment and profile user want to import. This is fully up to user and selection should be performed according to users habits. However, order of alignment and profile 
            should always respect following rule. Alignment's list index is always equal to first index of branch in the profile's Data Tree. 
            </p>
            <img src="Pictures/AlignmentSelection.png" alt="Alignment and profile selection" width="800">

            <h3>Create alignment</h3>
            <p>Alignment can be created in with <b>CreateAlignment</b> component. Final curve is represented by a nurbcurves on a proper coordinates.</p>
            <img src="Pictures/AlignmentCreation.png" alt="Alignment creation" width="800">
            <p><b>CreateAlignment</b> component has six inputs and outputs. First input parameter <i>AlignmentNames</i> is list of selected alignment names. Second input 
            <i>ProfileNames</i> is a Data Tree of selected profiles associated to each alignment. If abovementioned alignment and profile order convention is not repsected 
            and profile name does not match associated alignment name, warning message is shown. Input <i>StartSta</i> and <i>EndSta</i> are optional input. It is Data Tree of required start and end stationing for each
            imported curve. If stationing inputs are not used alignment curves are created in their whole length according to <a href="#part41">min./max.</a> valid stationing.<p> If start or end stationing input is defined 
            by user it must present as a Data Tree with value for each required profile. If user set stationing which is outside min./max. valid stationing warning message will appear and input will be ignored.
            Parameter <i>Namespace</i> is mandatory and corresponds to the <b>AlignmentNames</b> output parameter <i>Namespaces</i>. It provides component with the info about .XML file so file does not have to be reopend. 
            Last input parameter <i>Step</i> is optional and represents distance between consecutive points which are used for alignment curve creation as well as calculation of transition curves points. If <i>Step</i> value  
            is not defined, value defined in <a href="#part5"> settings</a> is used. Otherwives, input paramneter overrides value defined in settings and can be set induvidaly for each component. 
            <b>Plase note, if step value is too small it can increase computation time needed for alignment import. If step value is too large it will decrese precision of imported curve.</b>
            <p>Output parameter <i>Alignment3D</i> is a Data Tree of all alignment 3D curves imported from .XML file. Second output parameter <i>AlignmentXY</i> is a Data Tree of all alignment (horizontal profiles) imported from .XML file. Horizontal
            profile curves are placed in world XY plane according to its coordinates in .XML file. Output parameter <i>Profile</i> is a Data Tree of all profiles (vertical profiles) imported from .XML file. Vertical profile curves 
            are located in world XZ plane. Their X coordinate correspond with the stationing and Z coordinte with the elevation stated in .XML file. <i>AlignmentXY</i> and <i>Profile</i> outputs are always imported in full length which is present in 
            .XML file. On the other hand, <i>Alignment3D</i> is imported only between <a href="#part41">min. and max.</a> stationing. Moreover, each vertical and horizontal profiles are imported as a list of sub curves which represent profile <a href="#part4">parts</a>.
            Last parameter <i>Difference</i> is a Data Tree of values with calculated length deviation bewtween <a href="#part41"> min./max.</a> stationing and length of particular <i>Alignment3D</i> curve projection to XY plane. 
            If <i> Step </i> value is set correctly and import was performed correctly <i> Difference</i> should be close to zero. With greater values of <i>Step</i>, deviation can increase. 
            It is up to the user to define limit which can be considered as sufficient.</p>

        <p>In <i>Surface</i> tab following options are present:
            <ul class="paragraph-list-bullets">
                <li><b>Mesh/Brep</b>: if checked surfaces are imported as meshes. Otherwise surfaces are imported as surface or breps.     
                <li><b>Join to polysurface</b>: surface triangles/quads are joined into one single polysurface. Applied only if Brep are selected as a product of surface import. If surface is incorrectly defined in .XML file. Joining can result in multiple polysurfaces.
                If surface consist of huge amount of triangles/quads joining can be very demanings to computational time.  
                <li><b>Tolerance</b>: tolerance used for position of surface point inside boundary curve and for triangle/quad creation. If <i>0</i> is inserted then value of <a href="https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/rhinocommon/rhino.rhinomath/zerotolerance">RhinoMath.ZeroTolerance</a> is used.
                <li><b>Parallel</b>: if checked multiple processors are used for surface import.*
                <li><b>Number of precessors</b>: max. number of precessors allowed for parallel computing. Applied only if parallel computing is alowed for surface import.**

            <ul class="paragraph-list-bullets">
                <li><b>Initial curve division</b>: number of divisions of vertical profile curve during alignment point's XYZ coordinates calculation.***     
                <li><b>Flow step</b>: default distance of consecutive alignemnt's points. Values is overwriten by <i>Step</i> input parameter if defined.
                <li><b>Parabolic curve step</b>: distance (stationing difference) between points used during calculation of parabolic curve (vertical profile). If length of parabolic curve is smaller, step is automatically changed to 1/10 curve length. 
                <li><b>Transition curve step</b>: distance (stationing difference) between points used during calculation of transition curves (horizontal profile). If length of transition curve is smaller, step is automatically changed to 1/10 curve length. 
                <li><b>Tolerance Z</b>: tolerance used for Z coordination of alignment's defining points. If 0 is inserted then value of <a href="https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/rhinocommon/rhino.rhinomath/zerotolerance">RhinoMath.ZeroTolerance</a> is used.

        <p>*Parallel computing is used in specific parts of import. Using parallel computing may not lead to speed up import. See time result under the <b> CreateAlignment/CreateSurface</b> component.</p>
        <p>**If value equal or smaller then 0 is inserted, maximum number of processors is used.</p>
        <p>***Allignment's defining points are calculated from horizontal (X, Y coordinates) and horizontal (Z coordinate) profile with specific algorithm. Algorithm divide profile curve to defined number of segments where Z coordinates are searched.</p>

        <h2>Best practices</h2>
        <ul class="paragraph-list-bullets">
            <li>Always check result and compare it with original data.
            <li>If large data are imported, import can be demanding on computational time. Separe import from other parts of script (internalise result, disable components).    
            <li>Recalculate EndPoints LandXML components only if needed (.XML file changed).
            <li>When importing large surfaces use meshes first or unjoined breps. Join brep only after boundary is applied to specific area.
            <li>When importing large surface most time consuming operations are joining breps and showing result in Rhino.
            <li>Stationing is always defined on curve projection to world XY plane.
            <li>Length difference smalled then 0.1 mm (when using meters as default units) should be sufficient.
            <li>Step value from 0.1 m to 1.0 m should be sufficient.
            <li>Consider total length of alignment when defining step value.
            <li>Define and limit start and end stationing for alignment if possible. It will save your time.
            <li>Some uncommon rules (national code rules) may not be taken into account in LandXML files (personal experience). Always check result before desing.
            <li>Always check imported alignment correctness. There are three basic checks you can do (check length difference, check curve curvature graph smothness, check coordinates of important points at specific stationing)
